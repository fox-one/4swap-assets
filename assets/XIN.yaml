    blockchains achieve trillions of TPS, sub-second final confirmations, zero transaction
    fees, enhanced privacy, and unlimited extensibility. Mixin Messenger, the first
    dApp created on Mixin Network, combines Facebook Messenger-like features with
    a multi-currency mobile wallet. XIN is the native cryptocurrency of the Mixin
    Network, which also supports BTC, ETH, BCH, ETC, and more.
  - The Mixin Kernel  now supports 24 blockchains, over 50,000 cryptocurrencies, and
