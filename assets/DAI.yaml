intro:
  en:
  - DAI is an Ethereum-based stablecoin (stable-price cryptocurrency) whose issuance
    and development is managed by the Maker Protocol and the MakerDAO decentralized
    autonomous organization.
  - The price of DAI is soft-pegged to the U.S. dollar and is collateralized by a
    mix of other cryptocurrencies that are deposited into smart-contract vaults every
    time new DAI is minted.
  - It is important to differentiate between Multi-Collateral DAI and Single-Collateral
    DAI (SAI), an earlier version of the token that could only be collateralized by
    a single cryptocurrency; SAI also doesn’t support the DAI Savings Rate, which
    allows users to earn savings by holding DAI tokens.
  - Multi-Collateral DAI was launched in November 2019.
