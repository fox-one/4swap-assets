  - BNB was launched through an initial coin offering in 2017, 11 days before the
    Binance cryptocurrency exchange went online. It was originally issued as an ERC-20
    token running on the Ethereum network, with a total supply capped at 200 million
    coins, and 100 million BNBs offered in the ICO. However, the ERC-20 BNB coins
    were swapped with BEP2 BNB on a 1:1 ratio in April 2019 with the launch of the
    Binance Chain mainnet, and are now no longer hosted on Ethereum.
  - BNB can be used as a payment method, a utility token to pay for fees on the Binance
    exchange and for participation in token sales on the Binance launchpad. BNB also
    powers the Binance DEX (decentralized exchange).

  - 2017年，币安币通过首次代币发行(ICO)发布，11天后，币安交易所上线。它原本是部署在以太坊网络上的ERC-20代币，总量为2亿枚，其中1亿枚用于ICO。然而，随着币安链主网发布，ERC-20
    币安币于2019年4月以1：1的比例与BEP2 币安币交换，不再托管在以太坊上。
  - BNB是一种实用令牌，可用作支付手段，您可以用它抵扣在币安交易所的手续费，也可以用它参与币安LaunchPad（代币发行平台）上的令牌销售活动。另外， BNB还为币安DEX（去中心化交易所）提供动力。
