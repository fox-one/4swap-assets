  - Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own
    cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies,
    as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts.
  - Ethereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin,
    along with other co-founders, secured funding for the project in an online public
    crowd sale in the summer of 2014 and officially launched the blockchain on July
    30, 2015.
  - Ethereum’s own purported goal is to become a global platform for decentralized
    applications, allowing users from all over the world to write and run software
    that is resistant to censorship, downtime and fraud.
