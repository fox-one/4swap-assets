  - Polkadot is an open-source sharding multichain protocol that facilitates the cross-chain
    transfer of any data or asset types, not just tokens, thereby making a wide range
    of blockchains interoperable with each other.
  - This interoperability seeks to establish a fully decentralized and private web,
    controlled by its users, and simplify the creation of new applications, institutions
    and services.
  - The Polkadot protocol connects public and private chains, permissionless networks,
    oracles and future technologies, allowing these independent blockchains to trustlessly
    share information and transactions through the Polkadot relay chain (explained
    further down).
  - 'Polkadot’s native DOT token serves three clear purposes: providing network governance
    and operations, and creating parachains (parallel chains) by bonding.'

  - 波卡Polkadot为全球知名区块链跨链项目，由以太坊联合创始人、以太坊黄皮书作者Gavin Wood创建，旨在解决不同区块链之间存在的通信和数据传输障碍问题，曾被彭博社评为“2019年决定数字货币发展方向的4大项目”之一。
